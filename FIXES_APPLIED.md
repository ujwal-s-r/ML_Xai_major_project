# Video Processing Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified
The batch video analyzer was not working correctly because it was using **incorrect return value structures** from the individual processors. The test files in `tests/` were working fine because they used the correct structure.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Emotion Analyzer** - Wrong Keys
**Problem:** Batch analyzer was looking for keys that don't exist
- Expected: `'confidence'`, `'all_emotions'`
- Actual: `'success'`, `'dominant_emotion'`, `'emotions'`

**Fix:** Updated `_process_emotion_sequential()` to:
```python
if result and result.get("success"):
    dominant = result.get("dominant_emotion", "unknown")
    emotions_dict = result.get("emotions", {})
    confidence = emotions_dict.get(dominant, 0.0)  # Extract confidence from emotions dict
```

### 2. **Gaze Estimator (L2CS)** - Wrong Data Type
**Problem:** Batch analyzer treated result as object with attributes
- Expected: Object with `.pitch` and `.yaw` attributes
- Actual: **Dictionary** with `'pitch'` and `'yaw'` keys containing **lists**

**Working Example from `test_l2cs_gaze.py`:**
```python
results = gaze_pipeline.step(frame)
pitch_list = results.get('pitch', [])  # Returns a LIST
yaw_list = results.get('yaw', [])      # Returns a LIST
```

**Fix:** Updated `_process_gaze_sequential()` to:
```python
results = self.gaze_pipeline.step(frame)

if results and isinstance(results, dict):
    pitch_list = results.get('pitch', [])
    yaw_list = results.get('yaw', [])
    
    # Use first detected face
    if pitch_list and yaw_list and len(pitch_list) > 0:
        pitch_val = float(pitch_list[0])
        yaw_val = float(yaw_list[0])
```

### 3. **Blink Detector** - Missing Error Handling
**Problem:** No proper check for `None` results
**Fix:** Added null check:
```python
if result and result.get("success"):
    # Process blink data
```

### 4. **Iris Tracker** - Missing Error Handling  
**Problem:** No proper check for `None` results
**Fix:** Added null check:
```python
if result and result.get("success"):
    # Process iris data
```

## Changes Made to `processors/batch_video_analyzer.py`

### Emotion Processing
- ✅ Fixed key names: `dominant_emotion`, `emotions` (not `all_emotions`)
- ✅ Calculate confidence from emotions dictionary
- ✅ Added null/success checks
- ✅ Added detailed error logging with traceback

### Gaze Processing
- ✅ Treat results as **dictionary**, not object
- ✅ Extract `'pitch'` and `'yaw'` as **lists**
- ✅ Use first element from lists: `pitch_list[0]`, `yaw_list[0]`
- ✅ Added type checking with `isinstance(results, dict)`
- ✅ Added detailed error logging with traceback

### Blink Processing
- ✅ Added null check for result
- ✅ Added try-catch around reset() call
- ✅ Added detailed error logging with traceback

### Iris Processing
- ✅ Added null check for result
- ✅ Added try-catch around reset() call
- ✅ Added detailed error logging with traceback

## Test Reference

All fixes were based on the **working test scripts**:
- `tests/test_blink_detection.py` - Shows correct blink detector usage
- `tests/test_iris_tracking.py` - Shows correct iris tracker usage
- `tests/test_l2cs_gaze.py` - Shows correct L2CS gaze usage (dictionary with lists!)

## Expected Behavior Now

When you restart the server and run video analysis, you should see:

```
Received batch: X frames @ 30.0 FPS

[1/4] Processing Emotion Analysis (3 FPS)...
  Progress: 10/90 (11.1%)
  Progress: 20/90 (22.2%)
  ...
  ✓ Emotion analysis complete!

[2/4] Processing Blink Detection (15 FPS)...
  ✓ Blink detector reset
  Progress: 20/450 (4.4%)
  ...
  ✓ Blink detection complete!

[3/4] Processing Iris/Pupil Tracking (15 FPS)...
  ✓ Iris tracker reset
  Progress: 20/450 (4.4%)
  ...
  ✓ Iris tracking complete!

[4/4] Processing Gaze Estimation (10 FPS)...
  Progress: 15/300 (5.0%)
  ...
  ✓ Gaze estimation complete!

Sequential Processing Complete!
```

All four processors should now work correctly with proper data extraction and error handling.
