**Game Concept:**  
**“Buzzer Bombardment”—Cognitive Challenge with Distraction and Time Pressure**

***

**How the Game Will Work (JS/HTML/CSS Implementation):**

- The user sees a grid or area where target shapes (e.g., green circles, blue squares) appear for rapid clicking/tapping.
- **Main Goal:** “Tap the target shapes as soon as they appear.”
- Targets spawn at accelerating speed as time passes to create pressure.
- **Distraction Events:**  
  - Every ~5–10s, an audio buzzer sounds, a visual pop-up (“Ignore this!”), or a screen flicker happens for 0.5–1s.
  - During distractions, some targets may also be “fake” (e.g., red circle—do not tap), or contradictory messages briefly show (“Now tap ONLY squares!”).
- Game lasts for 60 seconds (or configurable).
- At the end of each distraction, normal gameplay resumes.

**What Will Be Recorded (Metrics & Logging):**

1. **Timestamped user actions:**  
   - Every tap/touch is logged with timestamp, target type, hit/miss status.
2. **Distraction event logs:**  
   - Exact time of each distraction, type (audio/visual/text), duration.
3. **Pre- and post-distraction data windows:**  
   - Reaction time and accuracy for targets in the 5s BEFORE and AFTER each distraction.
4. **Continuous gameplay metrics:**  
   - Overall average reaction time, accuracy rate, error rate, impulsivity (premature taps).
   - Sequence of correct/incorrect actions.
   - Disengagement markers (idle period > X ms).
5. **Recovery calculation:**  
   - Time taken to return to pre-distraction reaction time and accuracy after each distraction.
6. **Frustration markers (optional):**  
   - Post-distraction user self-rating (“How stressed did you feel?” pop-up).

**What Metrics Will Be Displayed for Doctors (With Time Series Visualization):**

- **Overall statistics:**
  - Average reaction time (ms)
  - Accuracy (% targets hit)
  - Impulsivity (wrong targets or taps before reveal)
- **Distraction analytics:**
  - Time series plot: Reaction time and accuracy with markers (“Distraction #1 at t=23s, #2 at t=39s”)
  - “Recovery slope” after each distraction: How fast does user return to baseline?
  - Error spike quantification: % error increase post-distraction vs baseline.
- **Resilience:**  
  - Table or graph of each distraction: latency to recover, error rate increase, number of impulsive/wrong taps.
- **Self-report overlays:**  
  - Self-rated stress/frustration shown alongside objective performance dips.
- **Session log:**  
  - Full time-stamped sequence showing when/what the user did relative to distraction events (doctor can replay or audit).

**How to Code/Log This (JS/HTML/CSS outline):**

- Use JS arrays to record each tap `{timestamp, targetType, isCorrect}`.
- Log distraction timestamps/events in another array and flag target events occurring in the 5s after those times.
- Calculate recovery metrics by comparing average reaction time/accuracy in the pre- (10s) vs post- (10s) windows of each distraction.
- Render time series charts (use libraries like Chart.js or simple SVG for overlays).
- Display a summary dashboard of averages, spikes, recovery times, and annotated time series.

**Clinical Value:**  
These metrics—especially time-stamped post-distraction performance and “recovery slope”—are direct digital biomarkers for cognitive resilience, emotional regulation, and depression risk, as recognized in psychiatric research.
